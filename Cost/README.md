## Introduction

This repository contains documentation and code in the format of hands-on labs to help you learn, measure, and build using architectural best practices.

For more information about cost optimization on AWS visit the Well-Architected tool in the AWS console, and read the AWS Well-Architected cost optimization whitepaper.

## Labs:

### Cost Fundamentals
These labs must be done in order from 1 to 5, starting at the 100 level labs.

- [200 #3 Pricing Models](./Cost_Fundamentals/200_3_Pricing_Models) 
- [200 #4 Cost and Usage Analysis](./Cost_Fundamentals/200_4_Cost_and_Usage_Analysis)
- [200 #5 Cost Visualization](./Cost_Fundamentals/200_5_Cost_Visualization) 


### Cost and Usage Analysis

#### 100 and 200 Level
These labs are from the fundamentals series and must be completed before you move onto the 300 series.
- [100 #4 Cost and Usage Analysis](./Cost_Fundamentals/100_4_Cost_and_Usage_Analysis)
- [200 #4 Cost and Usage Analysis](./Cost_Fundamentals/200_4_Cost_and_Usage_Analysis)


#### 300
These labs focus on specific items within cost and usage analysis and are used to acheive a specific outcome. They must be done after the 100 and 200 labs, however they can be completed independantly of each other.
